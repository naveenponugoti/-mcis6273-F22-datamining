    "##Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper examines pedestrian fatalities in Kansas and the USA, and finds that while the number of pedestrian fatalities has been increasing in recent years, there is no single reason for this change. The authors point out some weaknesses in their research, including the lack of data on pedestrian behavior and the difficulty of accurately measuring the speed of a vehicle at the time of impact. However, they believe that their findings could be used to improve safety policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##§ Task: Answer the following questions:\n",
    "(a) What time of day is most common for pedestrian fatalities in Kansas (over all years)?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of pedestrian fatalities in Kansas occur between the hours of 8:00 pm and midnight.<br>\n",
    "(b) How does this compare with the most common time of day for the US overall?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of pedestrian fatalities in the US occur between the hours of 8:00 pm and midnight, which is similar to the Kansas data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Looking at figure 11, would you say poor atmospheric conditions have a significant impact on pedestrial fatalities?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Figure 11,No, poor atmospheric conditions do not seem to have a significant impact on pedestrian fatalities.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) On page 392, the author states “For Kansas, speed limits between 30 mph and 40 mph account for 52% of total crashes (26%\n",
    "crashes for 30 mph and 26% for 35 mph or 40mph), …”. Why is this statement as written incorrect?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is incorrect because it does not take into account the number of crashes that occur at each speed limit. For example, if there are twice as many crashes at 30 mph than at 40 mph, then 40 mph would actually account for more than 50% of total crashes.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) The authors go on to explain the abnormally high number of fatalities at higher speeds with “… Kansas has lot of rural roads, where the speed limit is high and in rural roads, laws are not strictly enforced, all of which might lead to a larger number of fatal pedestrian crashes.”. Which of the suggested countermeasures would you think might successfully address this issue?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested countermeasures to address the issue of high numbers of pedestrian fatalities at higher speeds include better enforcement of speed limits, improved roadway design, and public education campaigns."
